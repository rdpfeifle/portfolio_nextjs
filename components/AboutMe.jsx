            From Brazil to the US, my journey has been defined by a relentless
            pursuit of dreams
          </span>
          . As a teenager, I set my sights on living abroad and making the
          United States my new home. Overcoming language barriers and financial
          struggles, I learned English on my own, and became a cultural exchange
          student.

        <p className="leading-relaxed pb-4">
          In this land of opportunity, I discovered a world full of diverse
          cultures and inspiring individuals. Although I initially studied
          Marketing in college, my passion for technology always burned within
          me. Guided by my childhood tinkering with computers and building
          projects, I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and became a Software
          Engineer.

          <span className="font-semibold">
            My journey has taught me that with unwavering dedication and a
            willingness to face challenges head-on, no dream is out of reach
          </span>
          . I hope to inspire others to fearlessly pursue their aspirations,
          knowing that each obstacle encountered is an opportunity for growth.
          As I embark on the next chapter of my adventure, I am filled with
          excitement for the future and the unknown paths it holds.
